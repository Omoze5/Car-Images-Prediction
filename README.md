This project aims to predict the brand of the vehicle being uploaded using neural network in pytorch library. The dataset used in this project was gotten from kaggle which only predicts if the brand is Mercedes, Lamborghini or Audi. More brand dataset will be included subsequently. The first step was to preprocess the dataset using transforms while converting the images to tensor, resizing and flipping the images. The model used was a pretrained model called Resnet 18.
